# counting_triangles

My C++ Solution to the problem of Counting Triangles:
" Given a list of N triangles with integer side lengths, determine how many different triangles there are. Two triangles are considered to be the same if they can both be placed on the plane such that their vertices occupy exactly the same three points. "
